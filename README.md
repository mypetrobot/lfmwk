### LFM Who Knows

The damn thing doesn't work anymore. Good luck.

To run the bot, do the following:
1. Clone this project.
2. Do `yarn install`. This will install all the dependencies needed for the bot to work. Do not close the terminal just yet.
3. Get a Discord token for your bot, you can get one [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
4. Get a Last.fm API key, you can apply for one [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)
5. Write those credentials down, as you will need them later.
6. Create a new file, called `config.json`.
7. Populate it as shown on `config.example.json`. (`whoknowschannel` and `jumblechannel` are optional fields if you want to limit where these commands can be run)
8. Run the bot by doing `node bot.js` in your terminal.
